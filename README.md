### Abstract
<p  align="justify">Unlike non-numerical entities, the number of research concentrating on information extraction of numerical entities is still limited despite a massive increase of data-driven approaches touching a wide range of sectors, including the finance domain. Many previous studies emphasised the use of pre-defined keywords to extract attributes and relations with which the numerical entities involve. This approach is less adaptive in capturing the context in which numbers and
 quantities appear, considering the flexible nature of numerical entities that allows them to fit in various contextual settings. This project proposes two extraction systems, namely NEAE-1 and NEAE-2, that adopt a high-dimensional multilabel classification approach and IndoBERT, a pre-trained BERT language
 model developed explicitly for Bahasa Indonesia, to tackle the extraction of numerical entity aspects in Indonesian financial
 news. The evaluation incorporates comprehensive observation of how the proposed system tackles numerous identified challenges:
 (1) extracting implicit aspects and change attributes and (2) extracting all relevant aspects for numerical entities representing
 multiple different aspects. The result shows that the proposed extraction systems outperform the baselines with a gain of up to
 41.4% in the F1 score. Furthermore, all systems incorporating the IndoBERT achieve a higher F1 score than the systems
 incorporating the Multilingual BERT with a reported F1 score gain of up to 10.5%, indicating a leveraged performance resulting
 from a better contextual representation produced by IndoBERT.</p>
